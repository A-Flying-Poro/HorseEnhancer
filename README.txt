# HorseEnhancer 

## What is HorseEnhancer?
Horse enhancer is a light Spigot/Bukkit plugin that modifies the behaviour of horses in Minecraft in order to enhance horse-related gameplay, and enable an equestrian economy.
Improvements include:
* Horses now have genders, and require compatible mates to procreate.
* Foal attributes use a more deterministic formula, with a configurable potential for improvement/regression over their parents' attributes.
* Configure the rate at which males spawn, increasing the desirability of stallions.
* View detailed horse information by leftclicking with a clock, including parentage, attributes, and owner.
* Geld males you've tamed by shift-leftclicking with shears, ensuring control over your prized bloodlines.
* Horses track who their parents are, and inbreeding is... inadvisable.
* Disables shooting your own mount in the back of the head.

## How to install
